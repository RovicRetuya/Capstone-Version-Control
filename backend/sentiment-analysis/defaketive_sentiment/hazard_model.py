"""Runtime model producing safety, defect and counterfeit badges.

The tagger here is LEXICON-BASED: it matches the curated terms in
`lexicons/risk_lexicon.tsv`, which already carry a category and a severity. It
exists for two reasons, and neither of them is "placeholder":

1. It makes the whole product path runnable now. The badge aggregator, the
   verdict, the database columns and the report UI can all be built and
   demonstrated before a single sentence has been hand-labelled, which is what
   keeps the annotation work off the critical path.
2. The evaluation plan requires a lexicon-only baseline to compare the learned
   smoke-term tagger against. This is that baseline, so the work is not thrown
   away when the CC tagger lands.

It will be REPLACED as the production tagger by the CC smoke-term model, which
learns its terms from hand-labelled sentences rather than taking them from a
hand-written list. Until then this model is deliberately marked unqualified, so
`qualified_for_integration` stays false and no result computed from it can be
reported as a validated accuracy figure.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
A hand-written lexicon only finds the phrasings someone thought to write down.
Its recall on hazards described in unanticipated Taglish is unmeasured, and
measuring it is precisely the job of the labelled recall sample. Do not quote
its numbers as model performance.
