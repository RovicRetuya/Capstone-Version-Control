"""Apply the DeFaketive model to scraped JSON or review CSV files.

REVIEW COVERAGE
Every usable review is analyzed. The old behaviour capped analysis at 100
reviews per product and sampled them in proportion to the star distribution,
which is a reasonable way to estimate a common rate but the wrong tool for a
rare one: hazard reports run at roughly half a percent of reviews, so a 100
review sample of a 2,000 review listing would be expected to contain zero of
them even when the product has ten. Reading every review is the only way the
safety badge can be trusted, and it is also what makes the completeness check
below meaningful.

The star-proportional sampler is kept, unused by default, so the research
baseline can still be reproduced exactly.
