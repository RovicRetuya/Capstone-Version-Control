# DeFaketive Philippine E-Commerce Review Analyzer

This research prototype collects public product and review data from Shopee Philippines, with beta Lazada Philippines and Temu connectors, then produces explainable Taglish sentiment and review-risk reports in a Streamlit dashboard.

The scraper is configured specifically for `shopee.ph`. It supports current and legacy Shopee product-card layouts and English Philippines review filters such as `5 Star`, `With Comments`, and `With Media`.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FisherFemboy/Capstone-Version-Control.git
   cd Capstone-Version-Control
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional But Recommended):**
   - Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Windows PowerShell:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Before running:
- Make sure all Chrome windows are fully closed.
- Prepare to log in and solve captchas manually if prompted.

### Basic Command

```powershell
python src/retriv.py -k "your_search_term" -n 10 -r 30
```

When you see the search page loaded in the browser:
1. Log in to Shopee Philippines (if needed).
2. Solve any captcha presented.
3. After continuing to the main search page, press Enter in the terminal to proceed.
4. Keep an eye on the browser; if another captcha appears at any point, solve it to continue scraping.

### Scraping Modes

1. **Review Limit Mode:**
   - Use `-r` or `--review-limit` to collect reviews in the marketplace's rendered order:
     ```bash
     python src/retriv.py -k "laptop" -n 5 -r 10
     ```
   This preserves the platform's normal order instead of intentionally oversampling low ratings, which would bias the research risk score.

2. **All-Star Types Mode:**
   - Combine `--all-star-types` with `--star-limit-per-type` to specify how many reviews to retrieve for each star rating:
     ```bash
     python src/retriv.py -k "laptop" -n 5 --all-star-types --star-limit-per-type 5
     ```
   This collects 5 reviews for 5-star, 4-star, 3-star, etc., in separate queries.

### Command-Line Arguments

- `-k`, `--keyword`: Search term (default: "Raspberry pi")
- `-n`, `--num`: Number of products to retrieve (default: 10)
- `-r`, `--review-limit`: Total reviews to collect per product (default: 30)
- `--index-only`: If set, only retrieve index data without details
- `--all-star-types`: Collect each star rating separately
- `--star-limit-per-type`: Reviews per star type (default: 10)
- `--chrome-user-data-dir`: Path to your Chrome profile directory
- `--site`: Shopee market; `shopee.ph` (or shorthand `ph`) is supported
- `--product-url`: Direct Shopee PH product URL; repeatable
- `--output`: Custom result JSON path
- `--pagination-retries`, `--pagination-timeout`: Review-page recovery controls
- `--checkpoint-every`: Save resumable progress every N pages
- `--no-prompt`: Dashboard-safe verification polling mode

Results are saved atomically and incrementally to `shopee_ph_<search_term>.json`. Review checkpoints allow interrupted collection to resume without duplicating saved feedback. Authentication cookies are stored separately and excluded from Git.

## Beta marketplace connectors

- [`lazada-scraper`](lazada-scraper) provides Lazada Philippines keyword, category, and direct-product collection.
- [`temu-scraper`](temu-scraper) provides Temu Philippines keyword and direct-product collection.

The dashboard automatically selects a connector for supported product URLs. Shopee remains the primary integration. TikTok Shop and automatic cross-platform product matching are not implemented.

## Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis is maintained as the independent
[`sentiment-analysis`](sentiment-analysis) subproject. After scraping, run its
CLI against this scraper's JSON output. This keeps data collection and review
analysis independent.

## DeFaketive dashboard

The responsive Streamlit dashboard adds shopper search/results/product-risk
views plus administrator overview, scraper, lexicon, database, and model
evaluation screens. It can analyze the most recent scraper JSON automatically,
accept an uploaded scraper JSON, or launch a live scrape through the supported connectors.

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
streamlit run app.py
```

Live analysis shows the three processing stages (scraping, sentiment analysis,
and risk computation). Shopee may still open Chrome for login or captcha
verification. The dashboard uses the current research formula and clearly marks
unavailable evaluation metrics rather than displaying fabricated values.

## Example Command

```bash
python src/retriv.py -k "laptop" -n 5 --all-star-types --star-limit-per-type 3
```

Use the scraper responsibly, keep request volumes low, and follow Shopee's applicable terms and local law. Shopee may require a login or manual verification; the script pauses so you can complete it in the opened Chrome window.
