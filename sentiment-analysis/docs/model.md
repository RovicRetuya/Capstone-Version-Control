# DeFaketive sentiment model

The first model version is a local, explainable extension of NLTK VADER for
English, Filipino, and Taglish Philippine e-commerce reviews. It does not call
an external AI service.

## What the model returns

Each review receives:

- positive, neutral, negative, and compound VADER scores;
- a `positive`, `neutral`, or `negative` label;
- the matched sentiment terms and their lexicon values;
- product-risk categories and matched evidence;
- an independent severity-based risk score.

Risk detection is separate from sentiment. A neutral sentence such as “The
battery stopped working after one week” still receives a performance/durability
warning even if its general emotional language is weak.

The JSON workflow also fingerprints normalized comments, marks duplicates, and
excludes duplicate copies from product-level aggregation.

## Install the model resource

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
```

## Analyze one review

```powershell
python -m defaketive_sentiment --text "Maganda pero mabilis masira"
```

## Analyze scraped Shopee or Lazada JSON

```powershell
python -m defaketive_sentiment ..\shopee_ph_laptop.json
```

The default output is `shopee_ph_laptop_analyzed.json`. The original scrape is
not overwritten.

## Analyze a CSV

```powershell
python -m defaketive_sentiment reviews.csv --text-column content
```

The output contains flattened scores, evidence, risk categories, and duplicate
markers.

## Research status

`defaketive-vader-seed-0.1.0` is an engineering baseline, not a validated final
research model. The Filipino/Taglish entries are deliberately kept in editable
TSV files under `defaketive_sentiment/lexicons`. Before reporting model accuracy, the project
must create a human-annotated validation set, measure inter-annotator agreement,
freeze training and test splits, tune thresholds only on training/development
data, and report precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices, and error analysis.

The preliminary product risk score is:

```text
100 * (0.30 * negative_review_ratio + 0.70 * keyword_failure_rate)
```

These weights must be confirmed with the research advisers and validated before
the score is described as calibrated product reliability.
